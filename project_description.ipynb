    "Note the extreme aspect ratio: much larger than the 4:3 or 3:2 that is typical of most cameras; suffice to say, the camera that stook this picture did not have a sensor that was this wide.  So how are these things made?  Stated simply, multiple images are taken, mutually identifiable points are located in each of these images, and the images are warped such that these points are coincident.  The matching stage might look like this:\n",
